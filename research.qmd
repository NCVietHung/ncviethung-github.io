**Post fait-accompli crisis de-escalation: An experiment in Japan**

Abstract: The risk of fait-accompli in the East China Sea is on the rise and poses a serious threat to peace and stability in the region. If it happens, can Japan back down to avoid war? This paper argues that the Japanese government can use a number of reasons to justify their decision to de-escalate, in order to limit the domestic audience cost. Using evidence from a survey experiment in Japan, I found that emphasizing a threat of war from China, the weaker power position vis-a-vis China, using the international court to settle the dispute and mediation from the United Nations will help limit the audience cost faced. Only emphasizing economic sanctions does not reduce audience costs. I also found a strong negative correlation between political beliefs and the approval rating for the Japanese government when they back down. 

**Examining Vietnamese attitude toward China: Moving beyond the anti-China framing (with Phan Xuan Dung and Richard Turcsanyi)**

Abstract: Common narratives hold that the Vietnamese public harbors predominantly negative feelings toward China due to past Chinese aggression, ongoing disputes in the South China Sea, and China’s economic and strategic influence over Vietnam. While there is truth in these assertions, our paper argues that they are too simplistic to fully capture the Vietnamese perception of China. Utilizing a new public opinion survey dataset, we show that Vietnamese people’s attitude towards China is more balanced and nuanced than often portrayed. Vietnamese perception of China varies across demographics (e.g. age, region, and education) and topics (e.g. China’s actions in the South China Sea, Chinese culture and the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese border war). Both the media and scholarly work should move beyond the ‘anti-China’ framing and examine the diversity of views that we underscore in this paper. A more nuanced understanding of how Vietnam perceives China is not only beneficial to the literature on Vietnam-China relations but also informative for the making of foreign policy in Vietnam.
